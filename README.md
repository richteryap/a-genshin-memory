> A personal documentation website serving as a digital travel log for *Genshin Impact*. It chronicles the regions visited, lore discovered, and the journey of the Traveler across Teyvat.

## 📖 About The Project

**A Genshin Memory** is a fan-made archive built to document the protagonist's journey through the seven nations. As my first web development project, it focuses on organizing game lore and visual memories into an interactive web format.

It serves as a personal "Archive" of:
- The diverse regions of Teyvat (Mondstadt, Liyue, Inazuma, Sumeru, Fontaine, etc.).
- Key landmarks and scenic spots.
- The narrative progression of the Traveler.

## ✨ Features

- **Region Showcase:** Dedicated sections for each nation explored by the protagonist.
- **Lore Documentation:** Summaries and notes on the history and culture of each area.
- **Visual Gallery:** A collection of screenshots and "memories" from the game.
- **Navigation:** Easy traversal between different chapters of the journey.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

This project was built to learn the fundamentals of web development:

- **HTML5:** For semantic structure and content organization.
- **CSS3:** For styling, layouts, and theming (inspired by the game's UI).
- **JavaScript:** For interactive elements and navigation logic.
*(If you used a framework like Bootstrap or basic React, you can add it here)*
